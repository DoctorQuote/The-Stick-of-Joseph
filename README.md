# The-Stick-of-Joseph
Ancient Prophecy designed for Our Times - now available using [pip install Bible9000](https://pypi.org/project/Bible9000/)!

Version 2.0 allows verses to be grouped together using one or many "subjects." Easily managed as well as shared via the new HTML report. 

The [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/pDHX4phEghs?feature=share) reviews key features and functions.

We've also a very interesting (ever if I do say ...) [FastPath](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_XdGfegEiEc) feature that you may be inspired to use in your own TUI-Taming 'Ops as well.

## Dread-Not
Pure religion has nothing to do with me controlling you - it has to do with God, controlling me. (Romans 13:7 / #28274)

Adam, after all, was permitted to do whatever she did.

By their fruit, shall ye know them?

So I make no apologies for the fact that I - like billions of others - get a great feeling when I read the scriptures. 

Indeed, in order to share the warm-and-fuzzy feelings with any who might be able to experience the same, I have learned many technologies. 

Here is where I share "The Stick of Joseph" (a.k.a. "The 81 Books of Terror" :^)

Sharing is caring?

## Universal User Interface
The Stick of Joseph is forever a console user interface.

### Why a TUI?
From our pockets to the clouds ditching GUI's permits maximum - dare I say global - software re-use.
